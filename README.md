Baby's first 2D platformer

Oh yeah! Let's make a game!

## Rules:
			Branches are a necessity for collaboration projects such as this one.
 
## What do Branches do:
 
			Branches allow us to make code without changing the master so if there's a screw up and someone happens to push it doesn't effect all the work or progress we've made.
   
			Branches are useful especially for people working on different parts for example let's say I've made code for the game and you've made code for a sprite. How do we make sure  theses things are compatible without changing the origin? The branch makes sure they're no conflicts or compile errors before it is pulled in and other can review to see if it is viable.
   
			For this project it makes conflicts easier to solve, a way to organize code, and check compatibility.
