Baby's first 2D platformer

Oh yeah! Let's make a game!

## Rules:
- Branches are a necessity for collaboration projects such as this one.
- Don't attempt to work on the same exact thing at the exact same time or it could result in merge errors.
- Pull into branch only if you believe you have enough worthwhile content.
## What do Branches do:
 
- Branches allow us to make code without changing the master so if there's a screw up and someone happens to push it doesn't effect all the work or progress we've made.
   
- Branches are useful especially for people working on different parts for example let's say I've made code for the game and you've made code for a sprite. How do we make sure  theses things are compatible without changing the origin? The branch makes sure they're no conflicts or compile errors before it is pulled in and others can review to see if it is viable.
   
- For this project it makes conflicts easier to solve, allows a way to organize code, and checks compatibility.

## Notes:
- Unity needs to be closed in order to commit your changes.
- Make sure your whole group is sharing the same version of unity.
- If making code, be sure to make different classes to allow for easy accessing of code rather than writing whole blocks in update.
- Set break points in your program or look at the console if there are runtime errors.
- Make placeholder objects as it will be a little bit before teamates are able to complete their assests, so sit tight.
- Don't worry if you haven't merged, once you think your assets are truly done, then merge.
- Always complete the next task if you can.
- Um... Add notes if need be?
